/**
 * ffmpeg-based audio preprocessing for Whisper.
 *
 * Converts arbitrary input (OGG/Opus from WhatsApp PTT, MP3, M4A, etc.) to
 * 16 kHz mono FLAC — Whisper's internal sample rate, which shrinks payload
 * ~10× and matches Groq's own cookbook recommendation. This keeps typical
 * WhatsApp voice notes (and even 30-min ones) safely under the 25 MB
 * Groq request ceiling without needing chunking.
 *
 * BOTH ends are staged to temp files, and for the same underlying reason:
 * ffmpeg needs to seek, and a pipe cannot.
 *
 * Input (issue #4): non-streamable containers — MP4/M4A with the moov atom at
 * end of file, the layout most mobile encoders emit — silently corrupt when fed
 * via a non-seekable stdin pipe. ffmpeg writes ~empty output and exits 0.
 *
 * Output (2026-08-25): FLAC's STREAMINFO header carries total-samples, min/max
 * frame size and an MD5 of the audio, none of which are known until the last
 * frame is written. The muxer writes placeholder zeros and rewinds to patch
 * them — impossible on `pipe:1`, so a piped FLAC ships with those fields zeroed.
 * Every local tool accepts it (ffmpeg, ffprobe and any player just decode the
 * frames), and so did Groq's Whisper. OpenRouter's upstream provider does not:
 * it returns a bare `HTTP 400 — Provider returned 400`, deterministically. That
 * broke every voice note the moment transcription moved to OpenRouter, with an
 * error message pointing at the request rather than the file.
